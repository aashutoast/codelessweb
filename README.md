# CodelessWeb Portfolio Website

This repository is used for the development and maintenance of the **CodelessWeb** portfolio website.

All contributions and updates should be made thoughtfully, as any changes to the `main` branch will be considered **primary** and are subject to deployment on the live site. 

Deployment is managed by the administrator and will be carried out on the **Hostinger** web hosting platform.
